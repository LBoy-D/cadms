## Overview

Configuration and data Management System (CADMS)is a product and quality life cycle (PLM/QPM) management system, featuring an innovative and progressive decision making engine, maximizing delegation and enpowerment of the people.

Every enterprise change starts with a change of state in one or more controlled resources (internal or external).

A change of state can be reported automatically by monitoring systems or by personnel via state change report.

Example 1: John is sick morning. This change of employee state can be reported either by John himself via phone, online or automatically by a presence monitoring device, lack of punching, inactivity on the workstation,...

Example 2: the server is down. Monitoring system generates a significant change of state report against the resources server, which gets into the system operator change in-basket.

 Once a problem report has been validated, it is reviewed for impact analysis, workaround  actions, it is either mitigated with turn into either a resolution task an action and turn into a change request, where their existing impact is analyzed, and solution are canvasssed/proposed.
